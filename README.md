# Dissertation: Connected Seat System
## Introduction: 
Smart Connected Seats serve as a helpful guide in public places like libraries and teaching theatres, assisting people in finding available and suitable seating. The Smart Connected Seats system combines a sensor-enabled chair and data communication centre. Every chair includes a millimetre-wave radar, to detect if someone is sitting down, along with sensors for carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity and light, to monitor the surrounding environment to ensure comfort. The communication centre visualises the data from the sensors. It includes model of the chairs, which rise when someone sits on real chairs, and an e-ink display to communicate the environmental conditions. 

## Hypothesis: 
How can a smart connected seat system using millimeter-wave radar and various environmental sensors help people to find a seat with better learning or working experience.

## Aims:
This project aims to implementing a smart Internet of Things (IoT) strategy on chairs, in order to transform the way we interact with these spaces

## Methodologies:
The Smart Connected System includes smart chair detector equipped with few sensors and physical twins of chair.

### Hardware:
#### Sensors:
This project use mm-Wave radar SEN0395, CO2, temperature and humidity sensor SCD30, and light sensor TCS3472. Use the code provided to test each sensor before integration.
